why
 1 Go to AWS s3, and create bucket.  
 2 Go to AWS IAM, click Roles from left pane, click "create Roles". 
   (Note: You will need to create two roles, one for ECS, another for other roles like s3.)
   - Choose service "elastic container service", then choose "ecs-tasks", 
     (For Fargate) add policy "AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy". (This is for executionRoleArn in task definition json file in step 5)
     (For EC2) add policy "AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role" for executionRoleArn.
   - Create another role(elastic container service & ecs-task) and attach your policy like "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy. (This is for taskRoleArn in task definition json file in step 5)
   (Note: If you are creating a execution role for AWS Batch Fargate, you'll need "elastic container service" with "ecs-tasks". then attach AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy policy plus others)
   (Note: If using AWS Batch EC2, you should choose "EC2" for the AWS service. You may need separate role with ecs-task and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy attached for the execution role.)
 3 Go to Amazon ECR, and create repo.
   - Open docker desktop in local, (docker needs to be running in background)
     create IAM user and attach "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess" and "AmazonECS_FullAccess" permission policies.
     run push_image_ecr.py
 4 Go to AWS ECS, click "Task definitioins" from left pane, click "create new task definitions". 
   (Note: If using GPU, you'll need to specify in task definition.)
   - insert json file. Attach the Roles you created in step 2. (Note, you can do this in python with boto3 too)
   - Go to AWS CloudWatch, from left pane, click "Log groups", and click "Create log group".
 5 Go to AWS ECS, click Clusters from left pane, create cluster.
   (Note: If you want to use GPU, you should use EC2, not Fargate, and choose instance type in cluster setting) 

 6 Run run_ecs_task.py, 
   or, create service from ECS cluster and specify the task definition.

Setup scheduler to run it (optional):
Using AWS Console:
Go to Amazon EventBridge Console:
1. Create a new scheduler.
  - Choose "Schedule" from left pane, and specify the time.
  - Choose the Target as "ECS Run Task".
  - Specify the following:
  - Cluster: Select your ECS cluster.
  - Task Definition: Select the task you created earlier.
  - Compute option: LaunchType/Fargate.
  - Task Count: 1 (since youâ€™re running one task per schedule).
  - Choose subnet you used for the container.
  - choose role, or create a new one automatically.

If using AWS Batch, the json file in Role should include ecs-task & Batch like below.
Don't forget to attach AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy permission & others like s3, cloudwatch.
